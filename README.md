# [GeOBIA - Click&Classify Project](https://github.com/geosynergy/geobia)
Research for approachs to automate the classification of remote sensing images. </br>
Here are the ideas and the currently state of the application.

###Steps:
* [Segmentation Tuning](https://github.com/geosynergy/geobia/blob/master/README.md#L16)
* Segmentation.
* Extract Attributes
* Machine Learning & Complex Networks.
* UI.
* Cloud Processing.
* Object Recognition.
* More ideas.

###Segmentation Tuning
**Ideas**</br>
Going to check the idea of [SPT](http://www.lvc.ele.puc-rio.br/wp/?p=1403), mainly the metrics that the program uses for check the quality of segmentation. Need to check too the result provided with tool of [OTB](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/), don't think it will be useful. </br>
I'm currently interested on Segmentation Covering metric that SPT uses, as we are going to work with superpixels.</br>
To achieve the parameters, planning to use [Feature Forge](https://github.com/machinalis/featureforge).
